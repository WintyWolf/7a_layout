             Why I Am In IT School:
             <br>
             <br>
             I needed a school to join and Nest caught my attention 
             <br>
             <br>
             I joined Nest because i needed a school to join and i wanted to see and learn coding
             <br>
             <br>
             I learned coding and it was VERY fun i actually enjoyed it
             <br>
             <br>
             I did some research that IT engineers make a lot of money but
             <br>
             <br>
             i still dont know if i wanna be an IT engineer because there are more fun activities
             <br>
             <br>
